# RaiNix
A bash script to handle RAI Italy broadcasting.
Nothing to say about RaiNix Usage.
Just start the script and hope that it runs fine.
For detailed info look at a very good article on this host:

A very nice article explain all the details about the script usage.

Have fun

p.s. I'm not used to develop my code on Github. I keep all my stuff on my own laptop.
So, likely, you will not see too many changes here :-)
