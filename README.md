# RaiNix
A bash script to handle RAI Italy broadcasting.
Nothing to say about RaiNix Usage.
Just start the script and hope that it runs fine.
For detailed info look at a very good article on this host:

A very nice article explain all the details about the script usage.
Rainix applies different default depending if the user is a normal user or the owner (Me).
This is done by checking who is the current user. I'm used to code being Root.
So, in any case you run RaiNixV3 using ROOT different defaults i.e. player, restream protocols and so on
will be used. You can nullify this behaviour setting the Owner var at whatever value you like.

Have fun

p.s. I'm not used to develop my code on Github. I keep all my stuff on my own laptop.
So, likely, you will not see too many changes here :-)
